AIM , THOUGHT PROCESS & INFLUENCE
My aim was to create a website that bests represents me in a simple and clean way. This is so that when people see my portfolio they have an idea of my likes/dislikes are, as well as what type of character I am.

 To keep it clean, I tried to use a small range of colors for my text and having a consistent format to help keep the reader and make key information easy to read. Though this is the most efficient way of portraying information, I still wanted my website to show my personality.

I tried to show my personality by short bursts of color in each section and have a unique image to tell a part of myself.  Each image I choose is representative of topics that IÕm interested in.
