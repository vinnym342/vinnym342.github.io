## AIM, THOUGHT PROCESS & INFLUENCE

My aim was to create a website that bests represents me in a simple and clean way. This is so that when people see my portfolio they have an idea of my likes/dislikes are, as well as what type of character I am.

To keep it clean, I wanted to use a small range of colors for my text and having a consistent format to help keep the reader and make key information easy to read. Though this is the most efficient way of portraying information, I still wanted my website to show my personality. I also wanted a navigation bar as it helps make the reader get the information required quickly if they only want to see something in particular. In terms of fonts I wanted to use a sans serif based font to put across modern design, and a less classical/vogue feeling.

The idea was to try and show my personality as short bursts of color with images of things that I really like or are slightly representative of me, whilst still keeping the overall simplicity and professional theme. The photos would also have the task of keeping the reader oriented and clear where everything starts and begins. I also wanted to use a parallax effect so that it makes interaction with the reader slightly more interactive.

## Build Process

I used figma to wireframe and design my website. This was my initial sketch

My final Mobile Wireframe

MY desktop wireframe

I originally wanted much more for the About Me section, but it removed it later because it was just too much for a reader to read.

The website we build would have to be responsive so I was initially tempted to use bootstrap. However, I wanted to make my portfolio in pure CSS as a challenge and make sure CSS was sound before I start using bootstrap as this would be a tool for learning.

## Sections
### Landing page
I made the landing page simple to make sure the reader knew exactly what they were reading and what to expect. I tried to make my photo friendly and made the photo of my face circular to invoke a playful and friendly nature, an impression I want to give of to who ever anybody interested in working with me. I also put social icons there incase someone was linked to my portfolio and they just wanted to contact me or see my work. I also wanted to put a navigation bar incase there was only a specific piece of information the reader wanted to see

### Projects
I wanted my projects to be next thing to be seen to establish at least some form of credibility before the reader sees anything else.

This includes a gif of my first command line app as well as my github link to see the source code for said project. It also includes my code pen link for all my future HTML/CSS/Javascript projects in the future.

### Technologies I’ve worked on in the future
This is just a breakdown of the languages/frameworks/technologies that I’ve done in the past to show what I can work. It also includes a blurb saying that I’m willing to learn more languages.


### About Me
This is for employers or future colleagues that want to know what type of person I am. I think it does help ease any doubts or uneasiness someone might have when working with someone new, if they get a genuine show of someones character.

### Whats going on now
During the time of creating this document, this section was more to emphasize the current position I am i.e. learning

### Contact Me
Hopefully if they have read thus far, they would want to contact me. I put it in the bottom just for the slight convenience it provides and just feel slightly more accessible.
